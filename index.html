            <p>
                Our game is a dating simulator unlike any other! (<em>ok, maybe not, but we tried real hard</em>)<br/>
                The lovely people that you are pursuing are the personifications of different programming languages.<br/>
                We have many of your favorites, or maybe least favorites, including: <br/>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Python</li>
                <li>C#</li>
                <li>C++</li>
                <li>Java</li>
                <li>HTML</li>
                <li>JavaScript</li>

            As of right now, we are still in development. We will soon have a demo ready for play testing. <br/>
            There are going to be several different endings in the game, such as ending with your favorite <br/>
            person, nobody, or <i>maybe even multiple?</i> I guess you will just have to see for yourself!
